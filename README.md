# Mongo-Scraper
A web app that uses Mongoose and Cherrio to scrape news headlines from ArtNews. 

[View the app here](https://art-news-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation
I created this app in order to gain experience using the NoSQL database MongoDB, Mongoose, and Cheerio (an npm package utilized for web-scraping).

## How it Works
First, click the "Scrape Articles" button at the top of the page to see the most recent headlines from ArtNews. 

Read through the headlines to find an article that interests you. You can save the article by clicking the "Save" button, and you can also view the articles at the original source by clicking the link.

To review all saved articles, click the "Saved Articles" link located in the Nav bar. Here you should see your saved articles, and you are able to both "unsave" them or write a note about the article. Click the "Add/View Notes" button to write a note or see previous notes!
